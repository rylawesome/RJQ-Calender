# RJQ-Calender

Usage Guide: Click on a row to add your item to the calendar, then press the save icon. When you come back, your item should remain!

Unfortunately internet cut out so was unable to do commits along the way (WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERED THIS!!!)

Went about this with a lot of commenting along the way to help plan my work as I was going, initially wanted to work this top->bottom but ended up getting the inputs working, then local storage, and then worrying about styling issues with the different colored rows depending on time of day. Although initially I thought I would be using the current time (at the top of the page) as a major variable, I ended up using a seperate variable that just keeps track of hours to make things simpler. Overall, I had to do a lot of research to get this working properly but I'm very pleased with how it turned out. If it helped me plan my code, I'm sure with it being done now it will help me plan my day!
